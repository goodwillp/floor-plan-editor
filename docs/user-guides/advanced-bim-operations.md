# Advanced BIM Operations Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers advanced BIM wall operations for experienced users who need precise control over geometric operations, custom tolerance management, and complex architectural scenarios.

## Advanced Geometric Operations

### Custom Offset Operations

#### Manual Join Type Selection
While BIM mode automatically selects optimal join types, you can override this for specific design requirements:

```typescript
// Example: Force round joins for aesthetic purposes
const wallConfig = {
  thickness: 6,
  joinType: OffsetJoinType.ROUND,
  customTolerance: 0.01
};
```

**When to use different join types:**
- **Miter**: Standard architectural corners (30° - 150° angles)
- **Bevel**: Very sharp angles (< 30°) or manufacturing constraints
- **Round**: Aesthetic requirements or curved design elements

#### Advanced Tolerance Management
For specialized applications, you can fine-tune tolerance calculations:

1. **Thickness-Based Tolerances**: Automatically scale with wall thickness
2. **Angle-Based Adjustments**: Increase tolerance for sharp angles
3. **Operation-Specific Values**: Different tolerances for different operations
4. **Document Precision Integration**: Link to overall drawing precision

### Complex Intersection Resolution

#### Multi-Wall Junction Optimization
When multiple walls meet at a single point:

1. **Identify the Junction Type**:
   - Simple T-junction (3 walls)
   - Cross junction (4 walls)
   - Complex junction (5+ walls)

2. **Apply Specialized Algorithms**:
   - Compute all miter apexes simultaneously
   - Resolve conflicts using priority rules
   - Apply boolean operations in optimal order

3. **Validate Results**:
   - Check geometric consistency
   - Verify manufacturability
   - Assess quality metrics

#### Parallel Wall Handling
For parallel or nearly parallel walls:

1. **Detect Parallel Relationships**:
   - Use angle tolerance to identify parallel segments
   - Calculate minimum separation distances
   - Identify overlap regions

2. **Resolve Overlaps**:
   - Merge overlapping segments when appropriate
   - Maintain separate walls when required
   - Handle partial overlaps correctly

3. **Optimize Connections**:
   - Create clean end connections
   - Eliminate micro-gaps
   - Ensure proper wall priorities

### Shape Healing and Optimization

#### Advanced Healing Operations

**Sliver Face Removal**:
```typescript
// Configure sliver face detection
const healingConfig = {
  sliverThreshold: wallThickness * 0.01, // 1% of wall thickness
  aspectRatioLimit: 100, // Remove faces with aspect ratio > 100:1
  areaThreshold: wallThickness * wallThickness * 0.001 // Minimum face area
};
```

**Micro-Gap Elimination**:
- Detect gaps smaller than tolerance
- Merge nearby vertices
- Extend edges to close gaps
- Validate topological consistency

**Edge Consolidation**:
- Merge duplicate edges
- Eliminate redundant vertices
- Simplify complex boundaries
- Preserve essential geometric features

#### Geometry Simplification Strategies

**RDP-Style Simplification**:
1. Set tolerance based on wall thickness and drawing scale
2. Preserve architectural features (corners, openings)
3. Maintain manufacturing accuracy
4. Optimize for rendering performance

**Adaptive Simplification**:
- Use different tolerances for different wall types
- Preserve high-detail areas
- Simplify background geometry
- Balance accuracy vs. performance

## Advanced Visualization and Analysis
