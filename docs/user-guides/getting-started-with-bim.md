# Getting Started with BIM Walls

## Introduction

The BIM (Building Information Modeling) wall system provides professional-grade geometric operations for creating accurate architectural floor plans. This guide will walk you through the basics of using BIM functionality in the floor plan editor.

## What is BIM Mode?

BIM mode uses advanced geometric algorithms to create mathematically precise wall geometry, similar to professional CAD software like AutoCAD, Revit, and ArchiCAD. Unlike basic mode which uses simple polygon expansion, BIM mode:

- Uses proper baseline curve offsetting
- Resolves intersections with boolean operations
- Applies adaptive tolerance management
- Provides shape healing and optimization
- Offers superior accuracy for complex layouts

## Switching to BIM Mode

### Step 1: Check Compatibility
Before switching to BIM mode, the system will automatically check if your current walls are compatible:

1. Look for the **BIM Mode Toggle** in the toolbar
2. The toggle will show a green indicator if switching is safe
3. Yellow indicates potential data approximations
4. Red indicates compatibility issues that need resolution

### Step 2: Enable BIM Mode
1. Click the **BIM Mode Toggle** button
2. Review the compatibility report if prompted
3. Click **Switch to BIM Mode** to confirm
4. Wait for the conversion process to complete

### Step 3: Verify the Switch
After switching, you'll notice:
- Enhanced wall properties panel with geometric controls
- Quality metrics displayed for each wall
- Advanced visualization options
- More precise intersection handling

## Creating Your First BIM Wall

### Basic Wall Creation
1. Select the **Wall Tool** from the toolbar
2. Choose your wall type (Layout, Zone, or Area)
3. Set the wall thickness in the properties panel
4. Click to place the first point of your wall baseline
5. Continue clicking to define the wall path
6. Double-click or press Enter to finish

### BIM-Specific Settings
With BIM mode active, you'll see additional options:

**Join Type Selection:**
- **Miter**: Sharp corners (default for angles > 30Â°)
- **Bevel**: Chamfered corners (for very sharp angles)
- **Round**: Rounded corners (for curved aesthetics)

**Quality Settings:**
- **Auto-Healing**: Automatically fixes geometric issues
- **Auto-Simplification**: Optimizes geometry for performance
- **Custom Tolerance**: Override automatic tolerance calculations

### Example: Creating an L-Shaped Wall
1. Enable BIM mode
2. Select the Wall tool
3. Set thickness to 6 inches
4. Click at point (0, 0) to start
5. Click at point (120, 0) for the horizontal segment
6. Click at point (120, 80) for the vertical segment
7. Double-click to finish

The system will automatically:
- Generate precise offset curves
- Calculate the exact L-junction geometry
- Apply boolean operations for clean connections
- Display quality metrics for the result

## Working with Wall Intersections

### T-Junctions
When walls meet in a T-shape:
1. Create the first wall normally
2. Create the second wall that intersects the first
3. BIM mode automatically calculates the miter apex
4. Boolean operations create seamless connections
5. Check the quality metrics to verify accuracy

### L-Junctions (Corners)
For corner connections:
1. Create walls that meet at a corner
2. The system computes exact offset-line intersections
3. Join type is automatically selected based on angle
4. Geometry is optimized for manufacturing accuracy

### Complex Multi-Wall Intersections
For areas where multiple walls meet:
1. Create all walls normally
2. BIM mode processes all intersections simultaneously
3. Advanced algorithms resolve complex geometry
4. Shape healing removes any artifacts
5. Quality dashboard shows overall accuracy

## Understanding Quality Metrics

### Quality Indicators
Each wall displays quality metrics:
- **Geometric Accuracy**: How precisely the geometry matches mathematical ideals
- **Topological Consistency**: Whether the geometry is valid and manufacturable
- **Manufacturability**: How suitable the geometry is for construction

### Quality Dashboard
Access the quality dashboard to see:
- Overall project quality score
- Number of geometric issues
- Recommended improvements
- Performance metrics

### Resolving Quality Issues
If quality metrics show issues:
1. Click on the affected wall
2. Review the specific issues in the properties panel
3. Use **Heal Geometry** to automatically fix problems
4. Adjust tolerances if needed
5. Re-validate the geometry

## Advanced Features

### Custom Tolerance Adjustment
For specialized requirements:
1. Select a wall or group of walls
2. Open the **Advanced Properties** panel
3. Enable **Custom Tolerance**
4. Adjust the tolerance slider
5. Preview the impact on geometry and performance
6. Apply changes when satisfied

### Visualization Modes
BIM mode offers several visualization options:
- **Standard**: Normal wall display
- **Offset Curves**: Show baseline and offset curves
- **Intersection Data**: Highlight intersection geometry
- **Quality Heatmap**: Color-code walls by quality
- **Tolerance Zones**: Show tolerance boundaries

### Batch Operations
For large projects:
1. Select multiple walls using Ctrl+click or selection box
2. Use **Batch Validate** to check all selected walls
3. Apply **Batch Healing** to fix multiple issues
4. Use **Batch Optimization** to improve performance

## Best Practices

### Wall Creation
- Start with simple rectangular layouts before adding complexity
- Use consistent wall thicknesses within the same building system
- Plan intersection points carefully to avoid unnecessary complexity
- Test complex geometries on small sections first

### Performance Optimization
- Enable auto-simplification for large projects
- Use appropriate tolerance values (not too tight, not too loose)
- Regularly validate geometry to catch issues early
- Consider switching to basic mode for rough sketching

### Quality Management
- Monitor quality metrics regularly
- Address geometric issues promptly
- Use healing operations conservatively
- Validate final geometry before export

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Walls Not Connecting Properly
**Problem**: Walls don't form clean intersections
**Solution**: 
1. Check that walls actually intersect (not just appear to)
2. Verify wall thicknesses are compatible
3. Use **Heal Intersections** tool
4. Adjust tolerance if needed

### Poor Quality Metrics
**Problem**: Quality dashboard shows low scores
**Solution**:
1. Identify specific issues using quality breakdown
2. Apply targeted healing operations
3. Simplify overly complex geometry
4. Check for degenerate elements

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: BIM operations are slow
**Solution**:
1. Enable auto-simplification
2. Reduce geometric complexity
3. Use appropriate tolerance values
4. Consider processing in smaller batches

### Mode Switching Problems
**Problem**: Cannot switch between basic and BIM modes
**Solution**:
1. Check compatibility report
2. Fix identified issues first
3. Use migration tools if needed
4. Contact support for complex cases
