# FloorPlanModel Implementation Summary

## Task 2: Core Data Structures and Interfaces

This implementation provides the foundational data structures and in-memory management system for the Floor Plan Editor.

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. TypeScript Interfaces (`types.ts`)
- **Node Interface**: Represents connection points with coordinates and connected segments
- **Segment Interface**: Represents line segments between two nodes with calculated length/angle
- **Wall Interface**: Represents walls with type, thickness, and associated segments
- **Supporting Types**: WallType, NodeType, Point, and WALL_THICKNESS constants

#### 2. FloorPlanModel Class (`FloorPlanModel.ts`)
- **In-Memory Data Management**: Uses Map collections for efficient storage and retrieval
- **Node Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with automatic connection management
- **Segment Operations**: Create, read, delete with automatic length/angle calculations
- **Wall Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with segment association management
- **Utility Methods**: Clear data, get summaries, maintain referential integrity

#### 3. CRUD Operations
- **Create**: All entities can be created with proper validation and relationship setup
- **Read**: Individual and bulk retrieval methods for all entity types
- **Update**: Node positions and wall properties with automatic recalculation
- **Delete**: Cascading deletion with proper cleanup of relationships

#### 4. Unit Tests (`__tests__/`)
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 30+ test cases covering all operations
- **Integration Tests**: Complex scenarios like rectangular room creation
- **Edge Case Testing**: Invalid inputs, non-existent entities, data integrity
- **Type Testing**: Verification of TypeScript interfaces and constants

### 🎯 Requirements Satisfied

| Requirement | Description | Implementation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **14.1** | Line segments defined using start/end nodes | ✅ `Segment` interface with `startNodeId`/`endNodeId` |
| **14.2** | Nodes track connected segments | ✅ `Node.connectedSegments` array maintained automatically |
| **14.4** | Referential integrity between nodes/segments | ✅ Automatic cleanup and relationship management |
| **9.1** | Initialize empty in-memory data structures | ✅ `Map` collections initialized in constructor |
| **9.2** | Store changes in memory during session | ✅ All operations work on in-memory data |

### 🏗️ Architecture Features

#### Data Integrity
- **Automatic Relationship Management**: Creating/deleting entities automatically updates related entities
- **Referential Integrity**: Prevents orphaned references and maintains data consistency
- **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid states (e.g., self-loops, non-existent nodes)

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Map-Based Storage**: O(1) lookup time for all entities by ID
- **Lazy Calculations**: Segment length/angle calculated only when needed
- **Efficient Updates**: Only affected entities are recalculated during updates

#### Type Safety
- **Strong TypeScript Typing**: All interfaces properly typed with strict null checks
- **Type-Only Imports**: Proper separation of types and runtime values
- **Enum-Like Types**: Union types for WallType and NodeType ensure type safety

### 🧪 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual method testing with edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-entity operations and complex scenarios
- **Type Tests**: Verification of TypeScript interfaces and constants
- **Manual Test Runner**: Simple verification script for core functionality

### 🔄 Next Steps
This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Canvas rendering integration (Task 5)
- Wall drawing functionality (Task 8)
- Intersection detection (Task 9)
- Node cleanup and merging (Task 10)
- Wall selection and editing (Task 11)

The data model is designed to support all future geometric operations while maintaining performance and data integrity.
