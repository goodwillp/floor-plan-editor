# Task 12 Implementation Summary: Proximity-Based Wall Merging

## Overview

Task 12 successfully implements comprehensive proximity-based wall merging functionality, allowing walls to be visually connected when they are within a configurable distance threshold. This implementation preserves individual wall properties while providing visual feedback about spatial relationships, enabling users to understand potential wall connections without modifying the underlying geometry.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Proximity Merging Service (`ProximityMergingService`)

- **Visual Merging**: Creates visual connections without modifying underlying segments
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Real-time proximity checking with configurable intervals
- **Event System**: Custom events for merge creation and separation
- **Property Preservation**: Individual wall properties maintained during merge

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
setProximityThreshold(threshold: number): void
startProximityChecking(intervalMs: number): void
updateProximityMerges(): void
getActiveMerges(): ProximityMerge[]
areWallsMerged(wall1Id: string, wall2Id: string): boolean
getMergedWalls(wallId: string): string[]
```
