# Task 15 Implementation Summary: Add Reference Image Loading and Management

## Overview
Task 15 successfully implements comprehensive reference image loading and management functionality for the floor plan editor. This feature allows users to load reference images (architectural drawings, floor plans, etc.) and use them as a background layer for tracing walls.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 13.1: Reference Image Bottom Layer
✅ **COMPLETED** - Reference images are rendered at the bottom layer of the canvas
- Images are placed in the dedicated `reference` layer with z-index -1000
- All walls and other elements render above the reference image
- Proper layer ordering maintained through PixiJS container structure

### Requirement 13.2: Wall Rendering Above Reference
✅ **COMPLETED** - Walls are drawn above the reference image layer
- Reference layer is positioned below all other canvas layers
- Wall rendering system unchanged, maintaining proper visibility
- Layer hierarchy: Background → Reference → Grid → Wall → Selection → UI

### Requirement 13.3: Default Locked Position Mode
✅ **COMPLETED** - Reference images default to locked mode when loaded
- `DEFAULT_IMAGE_CONFIG.locked = true` ensures locked state on load
- Prevents accidental movement during wall drawing
- Lock state clearly indicated in UI with badges and icons

### Requirement 13.4: Lock/Unlock Toggle for Movement
✅ **COMPLETED** - Users can toggle image lock state
- Lock toggle available in both full panel and compact controls
- Visual feedback through different icons (Lock/Unlock)
- Lock state affects all transform operations (position, scale, rotation)

### Requirement 13.5: Image Repositioning When Unlocked
✅ **COMPLETED** - Unlocked images can be moved and repositioned
- Mouse drag functionality for position changes
- Transform controls (scale, rotation, position sliders)
- Canvas fitting options (contain, cover, center)

## Architecture

### Core Services

#### ReferenceImageService (`src/lib/ReferenceImageService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Core service managing reference image state and operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Image loading from files and URLs
  - Configuration management (opacity, scale, position, rotation)
  - Lock/unlock functionality
  - Mouse interaction handling
  - Event system for state changes
  - Canvas fitting algorithms
  - Resource cleanup and memory management

#### Key Methods:
```typescript
loadImage(file: File): Promise<void>
loadImageFromUrl(url: string, filename?: string): Promise<void>
updateConfig(config: Partial<ReferenceImageConfig>): void
toggleLock(): boolean
setPosition(x: number, y: number): void
fitToCanvas(width: number, height: number, mode: 'contain' | 'cover' | 'fill' | 'none'): void
handleMouseDown/Move/Up(): boolean // Drag interaction
```

### React Integration

#### useReferenceImage Hook (`src/hooks/useReferenceImage.ts`)
- **Purpose**: React hook providing reference image functionality
- **Features**:
  - State management with React hooks
  - Service lifecycle management
  - Event listener setup/cleanup

  - Memoized callback functions for performance

#### Key State:
```typescript
{
  hasImage: boolean
  imageInfo: ImageInfo | null
  config: ReferenceImageConfig
  isLocked: boolean
  isVisible: boolean
  isLoading: boolean
  error: string | null
}
```

### UI Components

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive control panel for reference image management
- **Features**:
  - Image upload with drag-and-drop support
  - Lock/visibility toggles with switches and buttons
  - Transform controls (opacity, scale, position, rotation sliders)
  - Canvas fitting options dropdown
  - Reset functionality
  - Image information display
  - Real-time value display (percentages, coordinates, degrees)

#### ImageUpload (`src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: File upload component with validation and feedback
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop upload area
  - File type validation (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, WEBP)
  - File size validation (configurable limit)
  - Loading states and error display
  - Compact version for toolbar integration
  - Image information display component

#### CompactReferenceImageControls
- **Purpose**: Minimal controls for toolbar integration

  - Lock/unlock toggle button
  - Visibility toggle button
  - Conditional rendering (only when image exists)
  - Tooltip support

## Integration Points

### ToolPalette Integration
- Added compact image upload button
- Added compact lock/visibility controls
- Seamless integration with existing tool groups
- Conditional rendering based on image state

### Sidebar Integration
- Added 'reference' panel option
- Full ReferenceImagePanel integration
- Panel switching with existing sidebar system
- Props passed through from App component

### DrawingCanvas Integration

- Mouse event handling for drag operations
- State updates propagated to parent components
- Layer system integration

### App.tsx Integration
- Global reference image state management
- Event handlers for all reference image operations
- State synchronization between components
- Status message integration

## Configuration System

### ReferenceImageConfig Interface
```typescript
interface ReferenceImageConfig {
  opacity: number      // 0-1 transparency
  scale: number        // Scale factor (0.1-10)
  x: number           // X position
  y: number           // Y position
  locked: boolean     // Movement lock state
  visible: boolean    // Visibility state
  rotation: number    // Rotation in radians
  fitMode: 'none' | 'contain' | 'cover' | 'fill'
}
```

### Default Configuration
```typescript
DEFAULT_IMAGE_CONFIG = {
  opacity: 0.7,
  scale: 1.0,
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  locked: true,     // Requirement 13.3
  visible: true,
  rotation: 0,
  fitMode: 'none'
}
```

## Event System

### Event Types
- `image-loaded`: Fired when image is successfully loaded
- `image-removed`: Fired when image is removed
- `config-changed`: Fired when configuration changes
- `lock-changed`: Fired when lock state changes
- `visibility-changed`: Fired when visibility changes

### Event Flow
1. User action (upload, toggle, slider change)
2. Component calls hook function
3. Hook calls service method
4. Service updates state and emits event
5. Hook receives event and updates React state
6. Component re-renders with new state
7. Parent components receive state updates

## File Format Support

### Supported Formats
- **PNG**: Full transparency support
- **JPEG/JPG**: Standard image format
- **GIF**: Animated GIF support
- **BMP**: Windows bitmap format
- **WEBP**: Modern web format

### Validation
- File type validation using MIME types
- File size limits (configurable, default 10MB)
- Error handling for invalid files
- User feedback for validation failures

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Loading states with spinners
- Error messages with clear descriptions
- Lock state badges (Locked/Unlocked)
- Visibility state badges (Visible/Hidden)
- Real-time value display for all controls
- Tooltips for all interactive elements

### Drag and Drop
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Drag over states with different styling
- File type and size validation
- Error handling for invalid drops

### Mouse Interaction
- Drag to reposition (when unlocked)
- Visual cursor changes (move cursor when unlocked)
- Bounds checking for drag operations
- Smooth drag experience

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Proper texture cleanup on image removal
- Object URL cleanup after loading
- Event listener cleanup on component unmount
- Service destruction on hook cleanup

### Optimization

## Conclusion

Task 15 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive reference image loading and management functionality. The implementation:

- ✅ Meets all requirements (13.1-13.5)
- ✅ Provides intuitive user experience
- ✅ Maintains code quality and testing standards
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing architecture
- ✅ Supports all major image formats
- ✅ Includes comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Provides excellent performance
- ✅ Maintains accessibility standards

The reference image system is now ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. Users can load reference images, position them precisely, and use them as guides for creating accurate floor plans while maintaining the locked state by default to prevent accidental modifications during drawing operations.
