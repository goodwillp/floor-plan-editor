# Task 2.4 Implementation Summary: Advanced Intersection Resolution Algorithms

## Overview

Successfully implemented advanced intersection resolution algorithms for complex multi-wall intersections, completing task 2.4 and the entire task 2 "Boolean Operations and Intersection Resolution".

## Implementation Details

### 1. AdvancedIntersectionResolver Class

Created a comprehensive advanced intersection resolver with the following capabilities:

#### Core Features:

- **Cross-junction handling**: Resolves complex multi-wall intersections (3+ walls)
- **Parallel overlap detection**: Identifies and resolves parallel wall overlaps
- **Extreme angle handling**: Manages very sharp angles (<5°), sharp angles (5°-15°), and near-straight angles (>165°)
- **Network optimization**: Optimizes performance for large wall networks using spatial indexing and caching

#### Key Methods:

- `resolveCrossJunction(walls: WallSolid[])`: Handles complex multi-wall intersections
- `resolveParallelOverlap(walls: WallSolid[])`: Detects and resolves parallel wall overlaps
- `handleExtremeAngles(walls: WallSolid[], angles: number[])`: Manages extreme angle scenarios
- `optimizeIntersectionNetwork(walls: WallSolid[])`: Optimizes performance for large networks

#### Configuration Options:

- Tolerance settings for geometric operations
- Extreme angle thresholds (configurable, default 15°)
- Parallel overlap thresholds (configurable, default 0.1)
- Performance optimization toggles
- Spatial indexing controls

### 2. Advanced Intersection Types

Implemented support for complex intersection scenarios:

#### Cross-Junction Resolution:

- Analyzes junction geometry and determines optimal resolution strategy
- Supports sequential union, hierarchical resolution, and optimized batch processing
- Handles complexity scoring and strategy selection
- Creates proper intersection metadata

#### Parallel Overlap Resolution:

- Detects parallelism between walls using geometric analysis
- Calculates overlap percentages and regions
- Applies different resolution methods based on overlap characteristics:
  - High overlap (>80%): Wall merging
  - Medium overlap (20-80%): Transition zone creation
  - Low overlap (<20%): Standard boolean union

#### Extreme Angle Handling:

- Very sharp angles (<5°): Geometric smoothing
- Sharp angles (5°-15°): Bevel join application
- Near-straight angles (>165°): Collinearity handling
- Mixed angle scenarios with multiple specialized treatments
