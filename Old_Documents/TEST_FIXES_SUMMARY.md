# Test Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. useDrawing Hook Test ✅
- **Issue**: Mock model was missing proper wall creation properties
- **Fix**: Added `thickness`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` properties to mock wall creation
- **Status**: PASSING

### 2. IconButton Accessibility ✅
- **Issue**: IconButton component was missing `aria-label` attribute
- **Fix**: Added `aria-label={tooltip}` to the Button component
- **Status**: PASSING - Now all tool buttons have proper accessibility labels

### 3. CompactImageUpload Accessibility ✅
- **Issue**: File input and button had conflicting aria-labels
- **Fix**: 
  - Made file input use `sr-only` class instead of `hidden`
  - Added distinct aria-labels: "Load Reference Image File" vs "Load Reference Image Button"
- **Status**: PASSING - File upload tests now work correctly

### 4. Reference Image Tests (Partial) ⚠️
- **Issue**: CompactReferenceImageControls returns null when no image is loaded
- **Fix**: Added proper aria-labels to lock/unlock buttons
- **Status**: 13.3 PASSING, but 13.4 and 13.5 still failing because buttons don't appear until image is loaded

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Reference Image Lock/Unlock Tests ❌
- **Problem**: The `CompactReferenceImageControls` component returns `null` when `hasImage` is false
- **Impact**: Tests 13.4 and 13.5 fail because lock buttons don't exist until after image is loaded
- **Potential Solutions**:
  1. Modify component to show disabled buttons when no image
  2. Update test to wait for buttons to appear after image load
  3. Mock the image loading process more accurately

### 2. React act() Warnings ⚠️
- **Problem**: Many tests show "not wrapped in act(...)" warnings
- **Impact**: Test output is cluttered, potential timing issues
- **Solution**: Wrap state-changing operations in `act()` calls

### 3. Grid Rendering Tests ❌
- **Problem**: Some grid rendering tests are failing
- **Status**: Need investigation

## Test Status Summary

### Passing Tests
- useDrawing hook tests (12/12)
- Basic App rendering
- IconButton accessibility
- Image upload functionality (13.3)
- Memory management (9.2)

### Failing Tests
- Reference image lock tests (13.4, 13.5)
- Some grid rendering tests
- Various integration tests with act() warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix reference image lock button tests
   - Either modify CompactReferenceImageControls to show disabled buttons
   - Or update tests to properly wait for image loading

2. **Priority 2**: Address React act() warnings
   - Wrap async operations in act() calls
   - Update test setup to handle state changes properly

3. **Priority 3**: Investigate remaining grid and integration test failures

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/test/hooks/useDrawing.test.tsx` - Fixed mock model
2. `src/components/ui/icon-button.tsx` - Added aria-label
3. `src/components/ImageUpload.tsx` - Fixed accessibility labels
4. `src/components/ReferenceImagePanel.tsx` - Added aria-labels to lock buttons
5. `src/test/integration/requirements-validation.test.tsx` - Updated selectors

### Key Improvements:
